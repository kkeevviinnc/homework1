What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
A merge is the act of establishing the changes made in your branch to 
the master branch. Sometimes this results in merge conflicts that need to be solved. 
(such as when another developer edits the same file and merges their changes before you.)
A rebase is the act of shifting your branch to the latest version of the file 
(such as when you want your branch to catch changes in a later commit.)
